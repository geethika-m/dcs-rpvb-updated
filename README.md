### Project Background
Defence Collective Singapore (DCS), previously known as Singapore Discovery Centre (SDC), is a non-profit government organization with a mission to educate and engage both Singapore citizens and visitors about the country's rich history, culture, and national identity. DCS aims to inspire future generations to contribute to Singapore's future by sharing Singapore Stories. They offer a wide range of educational programmes, interactive exhibitions, multimedia shows, guided tours, and workshops that cover various themes such as Total Defence Day and National Day. DCSâ€™s key audiences are national service recruits, youths, families, schools, and corporates as their primary audience.

As of current, the Event Management & Planning Department faces challenges with their current booking confirmation process, which involves handling requests through emails and keeping track of them in an excel file. This is a concern as there is no backup in place which leads to potential data loss or corruption. 

To address these issues and increase productivity, this project was proposed and aims to automate the booking confirmation process and improve resource management. This helps to eliminate the need for managing multiple emails and the risk of losing important data. The web application will also centralize all booking requests and maintain a secure database for easy access and retrieval.
